# Documentation

## Description:
This project focuses on designing and implementing a system to generate C4 model-based architecture documentation for software applications. It will support the creation of all four C4 model levels—Context, Container, Component, and Code—using structured inputs such as system metadata, diagrams, and annotations. The goal is to streamline architectural communication, improve system understanding across teams, and ensure consistent documentation practices.
